# AR Animal Facts
## Marek Czerniejewski

This is a simple AR project done in Unity with the Vuforia engine. What this app does is display a video on the user's device
when it recognizes the target image, which is the computer monitor with a mountainous background. I originally wanted to use a blank
monitor screen but Vuforia had trouble recognizing the image so I had to add a wallpaper to the screen with some sharp edges to get
a good image recognition score. Mountains and trees were perfect for this. 

The app comes with a twist. There are no animal facts. It if in fact a rick roll, which is one of, if not the most popular internet jokes.
The aim of the joke is to pretend to provide someone with some some useful information (on the internet this is usually done by
providing a link to a resource) but instead of getting the required information it's a video of Rick Astley - Never Gonna Give You Up.

In this app instead of giving the user animal facts a video of Never Gonna Give You Up is played.
